Generate random wood chime sounds with flowing water for your site!

Simply unzip samples.zip into a "samples" (without quotes) folder. It should start playing automatically at page load/reload. In chrome you might need to click anywhere inside the browser for the sound to start! The file samples.zip contains over 1600 samples which only about 1000 can be used by the browser due to limitations.


Thank you!
